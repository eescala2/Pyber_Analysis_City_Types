# Pyber Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
### Pyber, a ridesharing company, has called on for a project to analyze their data to figure out the metric regarding total weekly fares, using city type (urban, rural, suburban). The datasets analyzed for this project gave insight on total fares, drivers, and rides, which led to the calculation of the averages of those metrics and their city types. 

### The dataset was also utilized to create a brand new data frame for average fare per week from a specified point of time, which for the purpose of this analysis was January 1st, 2019 to April 28th, 2019 for each type of city. After the development of the dataframe, a multi-line graph was crated to show total weekly fare by each city type. With this output, the information was provided to Pyber's chief executive officer to address issues in the output by type of city. 

## Results
### According to the metrics observed through the output, the urban city type holds the most amount of drivers and rides, with rural with the least amount and suburban drivers in the middle. In accordance with the populations of the average city types, this would make the most sense and be the hypothesized result. Since the urban market is the largest, one can conclude that the highest amount of revenue would come from that market. However, when viewing average fare per ride, rural atmospheres provide the highest average fare per ride and driver. One can surmise this is because rural areas have greater distance between destinations.  The average fare per driver for rural is $55.49, whereas the urban average fare per driver is $16.57.

### To best illustrate this, a mmultiple line chart was created to provide analysis and visualization from the time frame of January 1, 2019 to April 28th, 2019. Despite the higher averages og fare for rural, the amount of total fare for Urban is a lot higher for the timespan observed. The peak of profitability is also shown at the same time in the middle of Feburary. Urban cities aalso show to bring a large amount of revenue through March in the first and third weeks. 

## Summary
### 
* The city type of urban has the largest total amount for fares and most amount of rides. Thus, they have a majority share in the revenue for Pyber. For greater profitability in the future, Pyber should continue to invest in urban cities in the future. 
* For rural environments, although they hold the least number of rides and fares among the three environment types, hold the largest average per ride fare. This environment holds the largest marginability of profit per rider. 
* Suburban environments holds steady in the middle in terms of profitability, thus Pyber would be wise to stick with investment in their more profitable sector with urban riders and marginal profit per rider added with rural.
